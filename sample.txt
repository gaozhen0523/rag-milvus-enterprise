Milvus is an open-source vector database designed for scalable similarity search and AI applications.
It provides high-performance storage, indexing, and retrieval for embeddings generated by machine learning models.

Milvus supports multiple index types such as IVF_FLAT, IVF_SQ8, and HNSW.
It is commonly used for semantic search, recommendation systems, chatbots with RAG, and anomaly detection.

### Why choose Milvus?

1. Horizontal Scalability
Milvus can scale from a single node to a distributed cluster with billions of vectors.

2. High Performance
It supports GPU-accelerated indexing and search, enabling sub-second query responses even with massive datasets.

3. Flexible Data Model
You can store embeddings along with metadata fields such as text, titles, timestamps, and custom JSON attributes.

4. Cloud Native
Milvus is designed to run on Kubernetes and integrates with cloud storage such as MinIO or S3.

### Example Use Case: Knowledge Retrieval

Imagine a company with thousands of internal documents—PDFs, emails, Confluence pages, and meeting notes.
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system can index all content as embeddings.
When an employee asks a question, the system retrieves the most relevant chunks and feeds them into a language model.
This improves accuracy while preventing hallucinations.

### Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What is the typical embedding dimension?**
A: Many models use dimension 384, 512, 768, or 1024. It depends on your embedding model.

**Q: Does Milvus support hybrid search?**
A: Yes. You can combine vector similarity with keyword-based BM25 retrieval and apply ranking methods such as RRF.

**Q: Can I ingest large documents?**
A: Yes. Documents are usually chunked into small pieces (e.g., 300–500 characters) with overlaps to preserve semantic continuity.

### Additional Example Paragraph

Artificial Intelligence systems increasingly rely on vector search technology.
Instead of comparing text through exact keyword matching, embeddings capture semantic similarity.
This allows a query such as “How to scale my search engine?” to match documents like “Horizontal scaling techniques for cloud services”.

Hybrid search combines the strengths of vector search (semantic) and BM25 (lexical).
This provides significantly better results in enterprise search scenarios.
